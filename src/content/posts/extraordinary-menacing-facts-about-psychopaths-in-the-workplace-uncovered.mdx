When we think of the word psychopath fear comes to mind for many of us. The simple fact is that those who are psychopaths may very well be sadistic enough to find pleasure in the pain they cause. Sadly, a psychopath in the workplace can cause immeasurable damage to those at their mercy. Forensic Darkness aims to expose this very real threat so that those suffering can find hope and peace.

**Workplace psychopaths**

According to the FBI, corporate psychopaths may play mind games as well as lack empathy toward others (Babiak & O’Toole, 2012). Further, these psychopaths may only show emotion when manipulating others, making it even more difficult to gauge what’s real from fake and toxic.

Workplace psychopaths' might display the following traits:

- Narcissism and the attitude of being better than you.

- Cruelty without remorse or guilt for the pain they cause.

- Sadism, physical stimulants, excitement, and thrill at the pain they cause.

- Charming attitude meant to throw you off their selfish and hurtful intentions.

**Early warnings of a psychopath**

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychopathy is an offset of antisocial personality disorder (di Brito & Hodgins, 2009). Early antisocial behaviors begin in young children who show signs of rebellion early on. Sadly, over time a child who suffers continual abuse not only learns to adapt but may very well be studying their abuser to demonstrate the practice of not just abuse, but deception and manipulation. Subsequently that same child may then master the art of cutting off their emotions just to survive. It’s as if the abused child adapts to a life void of emotions simply because if they allow their emotions to take over, they might shut down completely.

Although antisocial behaviors can be present in youth, a person is usually not diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) until they become an adult. This is because ASPD only becomes a disorder when the behaviors are chronic (de Brito & Hodgins, 2009). In the case where the abused child becomes a teen, they would then need to be diagnosed with conduct disorder; also known as the repeated violation of laws before being considered for psychopathy (Lahey, 2008). But think, if the child is not diagnosed or caught for their childhood crimes then the child's path to becoming a psychopath goes unnoticed. 

Chronic antisocial behavior includes:

- Lifelong acts without remorse

- Impulsivity

- Irritability

The worst part of dealing with a psychopath in the workplace is the damage they do to others. Moreover, people who suffer from certain mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression are the most vulnerable to these often-cruel psychopaths at work. Working for a boss who is a psychopath can cause you to lose confidence in your work, as well as undermine your potential. You might also find yourself awake all night dreading what the next day will bring. Either way, the blow to your emotional, physical, and mental spirit is now both painful and life changing. For some, they develop anxiety at the thought of returning to a similar work setting going forward. 

Nevertheless, you have the right to be treated with respect without discrimination or harassment. If you feel that you have suffered emotional damage resulting in your job loss, you may need to find an attorney. Therapy may also be required to help you heal from the damage that was done to you. For information and help, or if you plan to sue your boss for discrimination or harassment, visit [NOLO](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/suing-harassment-discrimination.html) a legal website that offers not only legal information but actual help from attorneys ready to assist you with your case.

**The fight ahead**

Moreover, while human resources at your company needs to know what you are going through, it is your job to keep documentation of all incidents even if you believe the event is not worth documenting, just write it down. Often abusers will start with small acts of abuse only later to escalate the intensity of their abuse as time goes on; so please take the time to care for yourself daily. Know that you are worth more than the abuse you are given. If you are the victim of abuse whether at work or home visit the [Victim Connect Resource Center](https://victimconnect.org/resources/national-hotlines/) for a full list of resources available to help you during this trying time.
