### The Killer Who Planned Everything

By Victor J. Fisher

January 18, 2025

Israel Keyes was not like other serial killers. He did not hunt in a specific area. He did not target a specific type of victim. He did not follow compulsions that left patterns for investigators to trace. Instead, he planned his murders years in advance, traveled thousands of miles to commit them, and took secrets to his grave that haunt law enforcement to this day.

Between 2001 and 2012, Keyes is believed to have killed at least eleven people, though he hinted at more. We will never know the true number. On December 2, 2012, Keyes committed suicide in his Anchorage jail cell, taking with him the locations of unknown victims and the full scope of his crimes.

The Keyes case represents a new and terrifying type of serial killer: one who studies criminology, understands how investigations work, and deliberately evades the patterns that would allow detection.

## The Method Behind the Madness

Israel Keyes approached murder like a military operation. He prepared caches: buckets buried in remote locations across the United States containing weapons, ammunition, and supplies. These murder kits were hidden years before he intended to use them. By separating the acquisition of weapons from the commission of crimes, he eliminated traceable purchases.

When Keyes decided to kill, he would fly or drive to a location far from his home in Alaska. He paid cash, avoided surveillance cameras, and disabled his cell phone to prevent tracking. He would dig up a pre-positioned cache, commit his crime, then return the supplies to the cache or dispose of them carefully.

His victim selection was equally calculated. Keyes specifically avoided choosing victims he knew or who fit any demographic pattern. He once explained to investigators that he looked for opportunities: isolated locations, vulnerable targets, circumstances that minimized risk of detection. By refusing to develop a "type," he made pattern recognition impossible.

## Known Victims

The investigation into Israel Keyes began with his final crime. On February 1, 2012, Keyes abducted 18-year-old Samantha Koenig from a coffee stand in Anchorage, Alaska. He took her to a shed, assaulted her, and strangled her. He then left Alaska on a previously scheduled cruise with his girlfriend and daughter.

When he returned, Koenig was dead. In a particularly disturbing detail, Keyes sewed her eyes open and took a photograph with that day's newspaper, attempting to convince her family she was still alive while extorting ransom money. It was the ransom attempt that ultimately led to his capture: he used Koenig's debit card at ATMs in Texas, where surveillance footage and license plate readers identified him.

Once in custody, Keyes began revealing other crimes in exchange for considerations regarding how his daughter would learn about his actions. He confessed to the 2011 murders of Bill and Lorraine Currier in Essex Junction, Vermont. He had flown from Alaska to Chicago, rented a car, and driven to Vermont specifically to kill random strangers. He broke into their home at night, abducted them both, and murdered them in an abandoned farmhouse. Their bodies have never been found.

Keyes also confessed to at least eight other murders across the United States. Some victims were identified. Others remain unknown. He provided partial information, drawing maps and describing locations, but often stopped short of details that would allow identification. He seemed to be negotiating, trading information for control over his own narrative.

## What Made Keyes Different

Most serial killers are driven by compulsions they cannot fully control. They develop patterns because their urges dictate their behavior. Keyes was different. His murders were deliberate, planned, and disciplined. He could go years between killings, waiting for the right opportunity. He did not kill because he could not stop himself; he killed because he wanted to and believed he could get away with it.

This level of control is rare among serial offenders. It suggests a different psychological profile than the disorganized or compulsive killers who dominate case studies. Keyes was organized to an extreme degree, more similar to a professional criminal than a driven predator.

Keyes also studied serial killer cases specifically to avoid their mistakes. He knew that geographic profiling depended on killers operating in familiar areas, so he killed in places he had no connection to. He knew that victim selection patterns allowed investigators to narrow suspect pools, so he chose victims randomly. He knew that forensic evidence required physical proximity, so he minimized his contact with crime scenes and used untraceable weapons.

In essence, Keyes reverse-engineered the investigative process and built countermeasures into his methodology.

## The Unanswered Questions

Israel Keyes died with secrets. The FBI believes there are additional victims who have not been identified. Keyes mentioned crimes in multiple states during his interviews but refused to provide names or precise locations for many of them.

Some of these cases may never be solved. Without Keyes's cooperation, investigators have only partial information. They have searched areas he described, but remote wilderness is vast and unforgiving. Bodies may remain hidden indefinitely.

The families of these unknown victims face a particular torment: the possibility that their missing loved ones were murdered by Israel Keyes, combined with the impossibility of ever knowing for certain. Closure is denied them by Keyes's suicide and his calculated withholding of information.

## Lessons from the Keyes Case

**Traditional Profiling Has Limits**

Israel Keyes specifically defeated geographic and victimology profiling. Investigators who rely too heavily on these techniques may miss killers who consciously subvert them. Flexibility and awareness of sophisticated offenders is essential.

**National Coordination Is Critical**

Keyes operated across multiple states and jurisdictions. His crimes in Vermont, Washington, New York, and elsewhere were not initially connected because different agencies held different pieces of the puzzle. Only after his arrest in Alaska did the full picture begin to emerge. Better information sharing between agencies might identify such killers earlier.

**Digital Trails Matter**

Despite Keyes's precautions, he was caught through digital evidence: ATM surveillance, license plate readers, and financial records. Even sophisticated criminals leave traces. Investigators must pursue every digital avenue, as these may be the only connections available.

**Some Killers Plan**

The assumption that serial killers act on impulse is dangerous. Some, like Keyes, plan meticulously. Awareness of this possibility should inform both investigation and prevention efforts. Not every serial killer will make obvious mistakes driven by compulsion.

**Negotiating with Killers Is Complicated**

The ethical complexities of trading consideration for information are immense. Keyes manipulated the negotiation process, providing partial information to maintain leverage. Whether authorities received fair value for their concessions remains debatable. Future cases will face similar dilemmas.

## The Legacy

Israel Keyes terrifies because he represents a possibility: what if a serial killer were smart, patient, and disciplined? How many victims might such a person claim before random chance or a single mistake led to capture? How many such killers might be operating right now, invisible because they have made no pattern to detect?

These questions have no comfortable answers. We rely on the fact that most violent offenders are not as calculating as Keyes. We rely on their patterns, their compulsions, their mistakes. When a killer defeats these assumptions, our systems are strained.

The Keyes case has prompted revisions to how the FBI approaches serial crime, including greater emphasis on seemingly unconnected cases and improved information sharing. Whether these changes will be sufficient to catch the next Israel Keyes remains to be seen.

What we know is that he existed. Others like him may exist as well. Our vigilance must account for the possibility that the most dangerous predators are also the most patient.

Until next time, stay curious, stay vigilant.

Yours in darkness,
