If you are a surviving family member of a victim of a murder, there is help. While no one can even begin to imagine your pain, knowing that you are not alone is essential. There is a whole world waiting to support and guide you as you start to put the pieces of your life back together. 

In the U.S., local law enforcement departments will provide you with a list of resources to help you. Victims may be able to receive help from the Victim’s Compensation Program, which is a program that has helped victims become whole again. Those who qualify will be awarded assistance through the victim compensation fund available in their state. 

To summarize, violent crime may include the following: 

- Assault with a deadly weapon

- Child sexual assault

- Child abuse

- Battery

- Homicide

- Hit and run

- Robbery

- Sexual assault

- Stalking

- Terrorism

- Domestic violence

- Human trafficking

- Driving under the influence

- Hate crimes 

The funds awarded can be used to pay for your medical, dental, or mental health treatment. Victims could also get assistance with the income lost due to the murder. 

Further, suppose you are left disabled because of the crime. In that case, you could get help with home or vehicle modifications to help you going forward. If your loved one was shot or killed in your home, office, or vehicle, you could get help with the crime scene cleanup. Additionally, you could get financial assistance to relocate if you feel unsafe because of the crime. On the contrary, if you plan to stay in your home, you could get help paying for home security. 

To apply for victim’s compensation in California, visit the [California Victim Compensation Program.](https://online.victims.ca.gov/) You can also call the CalVCB at (800) 777-9229.

Residents outside California can visit the [National Organization for Victim Assistance](https://www.trynova.org/help-for-crime-victims/) for a complete list of resources and numbers to help you during this very trying time.  

**Criminals will pay**

When it comes to serial killers, once the police arrest a serial killer, the courts will make them pay restitution if the serial killer is found guilty. Suppose the courts find the serial killer has assets. In that case, the victim can use the value of the assets to pay the total economic loss suffered because of the horrific crime.

During the court process, the courts will request a Direct Order of Restitution which requires the serial killer to pay the victim restitution to help make the victim whole. Suppose you have suffered psychological harm because of the tragedy. In that case, the courts will require the offender to pay for mental health care. For more information about restitution, visit the [California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation Restitution. ](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/victim-services/restitution/)
