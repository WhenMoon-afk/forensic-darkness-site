January is National stalking awareness month and the[ United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-commemorates-national-stalking-awareness-month) vows to help victims and survivors find the help they need. Stalking is a serious offense and can be quite terrifying to the victim. If you are a victim of stalking, there is help available, but first, let us discuss what you can do daily to keep track of and hopefully end your stalker. 

First, if you are in fear for your life, the first thing you should do is let your core family and friends know you are being stalked. This way your family will pay extra attention to you when you come and go. If you plan to meet someone new, be sure to tell one of your trusted friends or family so they will be aware of where you are as the day goes on. Pick a check-in time and call them just to let them know you are okay. Use a tracking app like google share to provide an up-to-date account of your location. If you have an android visit [Google Location Sharing](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7326816?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) for help on how to set up your phone. For iPhones visit [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201087).

Let’s face it, if you are being stalked, it is your job to build your case which means you need to start gathering information which may be used to prosecute your stalker. With the help of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, a revolutionary app has been created for survivors and victims of stalking which can be used to keep track of abuse as it happens. This means you are now going to be a victim waiting for the next act which means you will be the “Watcher, not the Watched.” Forensic Darkness aims to promote safety and raise awareness always.

If you encounter your stalker while in public or online use the[ DocuSAFE](https://www.techsafety.org/docusafe) App to help you log events. Everything your stalker does may be evidence you can use to see they are prosecuted. The DocuSAFE app is free and can be used to gather, keep and share evidence of stalking and harassment. The DocuSAFE app will allow you to keep track of videos, photos, screenshots, and other messages. 

If a stalker is targeting you online you can use this app to log threatening messages, as well as keep track of fake profiles or accounts used to get to you. The point is that you are the only one who can build your case against your stalker and in order for you to do so, you will need not just help, but guidance on what to do. 

If you hire a legal counsel, be sure to check with your lawyer about what type of evidence is acceptable in court; while at the same time being sure to document even the smallest detail as it happens. Write it down, even if the incident seems unimportant, such as a missed phone call because this information may be used to show similar patterns or escalation of abuse. Further, it is important that you do not confront your stalker or egg them on in any way because to do so could be disastrous. 

While stalking is common with women, men can be stalked as well. Even more horrific is that some serial killer types are known for stalking their victims, treating them as if they are prey. Don’t let yourself become the prey; instead, stay alert and keep those around you informed. "Be the Watcher, not the Watched!" Forensic Darkness aims to raise awareness and help support victims and their families during the hardest of times. Stay tuned for more safety tips and guidance because in this life you deserve not just light and happiness, but safety as well.
