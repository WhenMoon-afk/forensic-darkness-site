### A Killer Made, Not Born

By Victor J. Fisher

January 4, 2025

Aileen Wuornos killed seven men along Florida highways between 1989 and 1990. She was convicted, sentenced to death, and executed in 2002. She remains one of the few female serial killers in American history who fits the profile typically associated with male serial killers: targeting strangers for reasons beyond financial gain.

Her case raises difficult questions about how childhood abuse shapes adult violence, whether cycles of victimization and perpetration can be broken, and how we as a society fail the most vulnerable among us.

## Early Life

Aileen Carol Pittman was born in Rochester, Michigan in 1956. Her father, Leo Dale Pittman, was a convicted child molester who committed suicide in prison when Aileen was still an infant. Her mother, Diane Wuornos, abandoned her and her older brother Keith when Aileen was four years old.

The children were raised by their maternal grandparents, Lauri and Britta Wuornos. By all accounts, the household was dysfunctional. Lauri was an alcoholic who became violent. Aileen later claimed she was sexually assaulted by him, though this was never proven.

At age 14, Aileen became pregnant. She claimed the father was a friend of her grandfather. The baby was given up for adoption. Shortly after, her grandmother died. Her grandfather then renounced her. At 15, Aileen Wuornos was homeless.

She survived through prostitution. She drifted through Florida, hitchhiking and taking clients along the highways. She was arrested repeatedly for various offenses including forgery, assault, and robbery. She attempted suicide multiple times. By her early 30s, she had spent years cycling between homelessness, incarceration, and survival sex work.

## The Murders

On December 1, 1989, the body of Richard Mallory was found in the woods near Daytona Beach. He had been shot multiple times with a .22 caliber pistol. His car and belongings were missing.

Over the following year, six more bodies appeared along Florida's central highways:

David Spears, 43, a construction worker. Charles Carskaddon, 40, a rodeo worker. Peter Siems, 65, a missionary. Troy Burress, 50, a sausage deliveryman. Dick Humphreys, 56, a retired police chief. Walter Antonio, 60, a truck driver.

All were middle-aged men. All had been shot with a .22 caliber firearm. All had their vehicles and possessions stolen.

The pattern was clear. Someone was killing men along Florida's highways. The use of stolen vehicles eventually led investigators to Aileen Wuornos and her girlfriend, Tyria Moore. Moore cooperated with police and helped extract a confession.

## Self-Defense or Serial Murder?

Wuornos claimed self-defense. She said all seven men had attempted to rape her, and she killed them to survive. This defense was complicated by several factors.

First, seven men in 12 months is an extraordinary number. While violence against sex workers is tragically common, the statistical likelihood of seven separate attempted rapes by seven strangers in that timeframe strains credulity.

Second, the forensic evidence showed that some victims were shot multiple times, including shots to the back. This pattern suggests pursuit and execution rather than defensive response.

Third, Wuornos took the victims' property and used their vehicles. While this could be opportunistic behavior following genuine self-defense, prosecutors argued it revealed the true motive.

The jury rejected the self-defense claim. Wuornos was convicted of six murders and sentenced to death six times. She did not contest the seventh charge after her convictions.

## The Question of Victimization

The Wuornos case forces us to confront an uncomfortable reality: violent offenders are often victims themselves. This does not excuse their crimes, but it complicates our understanding of them.

Aileen Wuornos endured horrific childhood abuse and neglect. She was abandoned, sexually exploited, and cast out as a teenager. She spent her youth surviving through prostitution on dangerous highways. She was almost certainly assaulted and traumatized repeatedly before she ever killed anyone.

Does this excuse murder? No. Many abuse survivors do not become killers. Personal responsibility exists regardless of background.

Does it explain something about how the murders happened? Yes. Wuornos was a damaged person operating from a place of profound trauma. Her hair-trigger violence, her inability to trust men, her paranoid interpretations of danger: these responses were shaped by decades of abuse.

Understanding is not excusing. We can acknowledge that society failed Aileen Wuornos without absolving her of her crimes. We can feel compassion for the brutalized child while condemning the murderous adult.

## What We Could Have Done Differently

The Wuornos case illustrates multiple points where intervention might have changed the outcome.

**Child Protective Services**

A child abandoned by her mother and raised by an alcoholic abuser should have received protection. Better foster care, family intervention, or removal from the home might have provided Aileen with stability during critical developmental years.

**Mental Health Services**

Throughout her life, Wuornos showed signs of serious mental illness, likely including borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Early mental health intervention could have provided coping skills and treatment.

**Services for Homeless Youth**

When Aileen became homeless at 15, there was no safety net. Programs for homeless teenagers, particularly those escaping abusive homes, might have provided alternatives to survival sex work.

**Services for Sex Workers**

For decades, Wuornos worked as a prostitute along dangerous highways. Programs that provide safety, health services, and exit pathways for sex workers could have reduced her exposure to violence and helped her build a different life.

None of these interventions are guaranteed to prevent violence. But the complete absence of any intervention guaranteed that this damaged child would become a damaged adult.

## The Execution

Aileen Wuornos was executed by lethal injection on October 9, 2002. By then, she had stopped fighting her sentence. In her final years, she made contradictory statements: sometimes claiming self-defense, sometimes claiming premeditated murder, sometimes expressing remorse, sometimes expressing defiance.

Her mental state was clearly deteriorating. She spoke of conspiracy theories, surveillance, and persecution. Serious questions exist about whether she was competent to waive her appeals and accept execution.

The state of Florida executed her anyway.

## Lessons from the Wuornos Case

Several lessons emerge from this case.

**Abuse Creates Abusers**

Not always, but often enough that prevention matters. Investing in child protection, mental health services, and support for at-risk populations can interrupt cycles of violence before they claim more victims.

**Female Serial Killers Exist**

Most serial killers are male, but women can and do commit serial murder. Wuornos fits many patterns typically associated with male killers: she targeted strangers, used firearms, and had a predatory hunting pattern.

**The Highway Is Dangerous**

Hitchhiking, sex work along highways, and picking up strangers all carry significant risks. Wuornos was both predator and prey in these environments. Highway safety education and services for vulnerable populations remain important.

**Damaged People Deserve Both Compassion and Accountability**

We do not help anyone by pretending that abused people cannot commit terrible acts. Nor do we help by treating abused offenders as purely evil monsters with no human complexity. Aileen Wuornos was both a victim and a killer. Holding both truths is difficult but necessary.

## Conclusion

Aileen Wuornos died violently, as she lived. Her seven victims are dead. Her victims' families carry their grief. The systems that failed her as a child continued to fail others after her.

The Wuornos case is not a story with heroes. It is a story of cascading failures: of family, of institutions, and finally of Aileen herself. She made choices that cannot be defended. But she made them from a place of such profound damage that simple condemnation feels inadequate.

We can condemn her crimes and wish things had been different. We can execute killers and still believe we could prevent future killers through better policy. We can hold complexity without losing moral clarity.

That is the uncomfortable lesson of Aileen Wuornos.

Until next time, stay curious, stay vigilant.

Yours in darkness,
