In 2003, according to the [United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/dec) over 3,000 children alarmingly were recovered from raided meth labs. As a result of living in such an environment, children were found to not only have been neglected but also suffered traumatic abuse. Subsequently, these children became afflicted with various emotional and mental trauma which sadly left them devastated by the horrific events they had to endure.

To aid children at risk, the [National Alliance of Drug Endangered Children](https://nationaldec.org/wp-content/uploads/CheckDEC-4x11-with-Instructions-and-Spanish-versions.pdf) designed an app to bring children and families together with help and resources in hopes to see more and more children in drug-free environments.

**At-risk children may be:**

- Living in a meth lab or other drug environment.

- Be the child of a parent who is addicted to drugs or alcohol.

- Be in a school or social media environment riddled with drugs.

Forensic Darkness firmly believes today’s families lack proper help when it comes to drug and alcohol addiction. Our aim at Forensic Darkness is to equip families with the help they need to find a better way of living.  As a parent, if you feel you are not equipped to talk about drugs to your child, the [CheckDec](https://nationaldec.org/wp-content/uploads/CheckDEC-4x11-with-Instructions-and-Spanish-versions.pdf) app is a great resource to help you navigate your way to help and resources designed to connect you with the many local resources available to you.

**The [CheckDec](https://nationaldec.org/checkdec-app/) may help with:**

- Addiction and recovery.

- Mental and behavioral health.

- Domestic abuse and sexual assault services.

- Drug information & pill identifier.

- Services for daily needs such as clothes, food, shelter, housing, and assistance with heating/cooling services.

- Training and videos to [help kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsibdwKQp-4) and parents establish good coping skills etc. 

- Local support to assist with personal needs such as disability, transportation, veteran services, and more.  

Sadly, social media makes drugs extraordinarily enticing, so keep in mind that children need to be taught the dangers of doing drugs so they will do their best to avoid them. As a parent, it is important to teach your children about the perils of using drugs and alcohol. Show them what can happen, that they could die, and tell them you love them and want to keep them safe always.

Tragically many people learn the hard way that using drugs or alcohol can make depression, anxiety, or other problems shamefully worse which can then result in the unraveling of a person’s entire life. If you are struggling with drug or alcohol addiction, you are not alone and Forensic Darkness is here and committed to providing the essential help and guidance we all need to keep our loved ones safe, both mentally and physically.
