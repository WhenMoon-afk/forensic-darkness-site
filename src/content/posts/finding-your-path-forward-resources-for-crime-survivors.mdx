If you have survived a violent crime, the aftermath can feel overwhelming. The trauma does not end when the crime ends. Survivors often struggle with fear, anger, grief, and confusion for months or years afterward. You may feel alone in your pain. You are not.

Millions of people have survived violent crimes and rebuilt their lives. Resources exist to help you do the same. This guide provides information about support services available to crime survivors across the United States.

## Immediate Help

If you are in immediate danger, call 911. If you need to talk to someone right now about what happened to you, these hotlines operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

**National Domestic Violence Hotline**: 1-800-799-7233. Trained advocates provide support, safety planning, and referrals to local resources. Services available in over 200 languages.

**RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network)**: 1-800-656-4673. The nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization operates this hotline and connects callers with local service providers.

**National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: Call or text 988. Crime survivors sometimes experience thoughts of self-harm. If you are having such thoughts, please reach out. Help is available.

## Victim Compensation Programs

Every state operates a victim compensation program that helps cover costs related to violent crime. These programs can assist with medical expenses, mental health counseling, lost wages, funeral costs, and relocation expenses.

To apply, contact your state's victim compensation office or ask a victim advocate for help with the application. Most programs require that the crime was reported to police, though exceptions exist in some states.

The Office for Victims of Crime maintains a directory of state programs at [ovc.ojp.gov](https://ovc.ojp.gov/). This federal agency also funds victim services programs throughout the country.

## Finding a Therapist

Trauma changes the brain. Professional help can make a significant difference in recovery. Look for therapists who specialize in trauma, particularly those trained in evidence-based approaches like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy.

If cost is a concern, many victim services organizations offer free or low-cost counseling. Community mental health centers often provide services on a sliding scale based on income. Your victim compensation program may cover therapy costs.

## Support Groups

Connecting with other survivors can reduce isolation and provide practical guidance from people who understand your experience. The National Organization for Victim Assistance maintains a database of support groups organized by location and type of crime.

Online support communities offer another option, particularly for survivors in rural areas or those who prefer anonymity. However, choose carefully. Look for groups moderated by trained professionals or established organizations.

## Legal Assistance

Navigating the criminal justice system can be confusing and retraumatizing. Victim advocates, often available through prosecutor offices or nonprofit organizations, can explain your rights, accompany you to court proceedings, and help you prepare victim impact statements.

If you need legal representation for civil matters related to your victimization, organizations like the National Crime Victim Law Institute can help locate attorneys who specialize in victim rights.

## The Healing Process

Recovery is not linear. You may have good days and bad days. Progress may feel slow. These experiences are normal.

Some things that may help:

**Establish safety routines.** Trauma often leaves survivors feeling unsafe. Creating predictable daily routines can help restore a sense of control.

**Move at your own pace.** Well-meaning people may tell you to move on or get over it. You do not owe anyone a timeline for your healing. Take the time you need.

**Care for your body.** Trauma affects physical health. Try to maintain regular sleep, eat nourishing food, and engage in gentle movement when possible.

**Limit media consumption.** Crime coverage in news and entertainment can trigger distressing memories. It is okay to turn it off.

**Celebrate small victories.** Getting through a difficult day counts. Going to an appointment counts. Every step forward matters.
