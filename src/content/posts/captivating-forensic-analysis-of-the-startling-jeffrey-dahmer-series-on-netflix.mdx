Netflix has a way of bringing to life history in a manner meant to bring out our emotions. Serial killers who dismember their victims are thought to be some of the sickest people alive. To think someone could do such horrible things to others is unthinkable yet almost sad, too sad, honestly. This article aims to further study the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer so we might be able to understand why he committed these heinous crimes.

Why ask?

Forensic psychology requires practitioners to investigate a person entirely. Do they have a mental illness? Do they have a developmental disability? Do they have a neurological disorder causing slowed speech or other cognitive deficits? Is their family and school environment healthy? Are they suffering from substance abuse or anger problems? The job of a forensic psychology professional is to get to the bottom of what is causing the offender to do what they do. Forensic Darkness aims to shed light on the why behind some of serial killers’ worst behaviors.

The study of forensic psychology examines the serial killer’s entire life which includes:

- Age & environment.

- IQ & brain functions.

- Genetics, and mental illnesses.

Netflix truth or fiction

Evan Peters portrayed Jeffrey Dahmer in a relatable way and not as a monster. Dahmer’s demeanor was respectful around others. Dahmer was quiet and did not show any outward emotions even when he was being confronted. The way Evan Peters portrayed Dahmer was as someone who was timid and not the type of person one would think to be a sadistic serial killer.

At an early age, Dahmer struggled with being accepted by his peers. Dahmer became fascinated with mutilating animal bodies, which he did to bond with his father. The act of dismembering animals not only caused Dahmer to become desensitized to such acts, but it also gave him a feeling of control which he later found stimulating. Absorbed with the action of mutilation Dahmer later expressed his curiosity by practicing on humans. Dahmer felt a sense of control and appeared to feel powerful. Dahmer seemed to enjoy those moments he shared with his victims.

The Netflix series showed us that Jeffrey Dahmer came from a broken home and that he suffered from being emotionally neglected, primarily by his mother. Dahmer also feared abandonment because his parents basically left him alone. His fear of abandonment became apparent as we witnessed Dahmer panic each time one of his victims threatened to leave. Dahmer did whatever he could to make sure his victims couldn’t leave including killing them. He resorted to immediate violence if necessary and later when he became more sophisticated as a serial killer, Dahmer began drugging his victims so he could further experiment believing his victims could feel no pain.

Ultimately, Evan Peters portrayed a serial killer who was vulnerable and in desperate need of companionship. Sadly, people who don’t have friends may be socially awkward, meaning they have trouble relating to others. Later, Dahmer was able to find friends in his newfound mostly male nightclub where he was able to try out his alcohol-fused social skills. Having the power to attract others, Dahmer was able to advance on his fascination with dissecting animals as a kid. The Netflix special showed father and son bonding over collecting and dissecting animals but, this did not happen. 

Analysis

When it comes to serial killers, forensic psychology professionals ask the question, what is life like for the serial killer? Did the serial killer grow up in a broken home? Do mental illnesses like schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, or other mental illness run in the family?  What could be the real cause of such behavior?

Compulsions drive us. Compulsions can define us and what we decide to do and when. A person who develops urges or compulsions is stuck in a loop. This person behaves in an obsessive way and is habitual to the point of satisfaction. Young Jeffrey obviously felt urges to dissect animals so later when he began his killing spree, he was able to feed his urges in new and utterly grotesque ways. It was as if Dahmer wanted to try new ways to kill, dismember, and torture. This behavior is obsessive. Dahmer experienced compulsions or urges that gave him an emotional and physical biological reward. He felt in control.

Symptoms of mental illness explained:

According to the DSM-V, a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) will have redundant ideas, and thoughts (American Psychiatric Association, 2023). It appears Dahmer developed the need or compulsion to continue his childhood dissection experiments only directly with humans.

To be diagnosed with OCD a person would have to show signs of obsessional thoughts or compulsions for more than an hour a day. Ultimately it seemed that Jeffrey was more comfortable around the dead than the living. In Dahmer's mind, he was living a real-life horror show each time he killed. After committing the most gruesome acts on his victims, Dahmer admitted that he drugged some of his victims so they wouldn't feel anything. Do you think this act means Dahmer cares deep down?

Dahmer, driven by his sexual fantasies and impulses, inflicted new and different torture and pain on his victims. To give you a little more background, according to John Hopkins Psychiatry Guide, the act of finding unusual things sexually interesting is called a paraphilic disorder. Parts of the Dahmer show depicted moments when Dahmer became fascinated with the mannequin, which was to become his canvas to paint his upcoming murder dissecting episodes in which he seemed to become aroused sexually.

The way that Dahmer seemed to be aroused when he was torturing or killing his victims shows us that he may have developed a paraphilic disorder over time. A paraphilic disorder is when someone experiences intense sexual urges, and fantasies with the satisfaction to inflict harm on others (Lerner & Berlin, 2017). Basically, the word paraphilia means having a sexual interest in deviant ways such as sexual sadism in the case of Dahmer. The purpose of this article is to speculate on the facts not fiction presented by the Netflix Dahmer movie. For a full overview of Jeffrey Dahmer’s diagnosis take a look at [Inside the Mind of Jeffrey Dahmer](https://sites.psu.edu/kcruzpassionblog/2019/10/11/inside-the-mind-of-jeffrey-dahmer/) article.

Sadly, because of the Jeffrey Dahmer Netflix show the family of the victims has had to endure the whole tragedy again. We here at Forensic Darkness can only express our most profound support to the families suffering from these tragic killings. Normal society cannot even begin to comprehend how someone could do such heinous acts. Still, this analysis must be done so forensic psychology professionals can attempt to avoid future serial killers.

Our children, our future

OCD does exist in children. If you have a child, please be aware your child might have OCD so it is up to you as their parent to help guide them onto healthy obsessions. Take the time to talk with them about what they feel so you can gain a better understanding of how your child might think. While the case with Dahmer and his father both bonding from mutilating animals is not real, we need to monitor what our kids are seeing. Unfortunately, when children are constantly exposed to death or killing, they may find the very act itself just a little bit too interesting. As parents we need to show our children that death is not the answer. Show them that love wins every time. Thank you for visiting Forensic Darkness today.
