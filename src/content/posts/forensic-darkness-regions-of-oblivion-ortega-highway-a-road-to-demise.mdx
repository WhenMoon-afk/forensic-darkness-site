description: "The dark history of California's Ortega Highway - examining body dump sites, serial killer connections, and unsolved mysteries."
---

The Ortega Highway, also called State Route 74, is a historically significant and scenic road located in Southern California. This highway not only covers 28 miles of mountainous terrain, but it also has a reputation for being eerie and mysterious. Some believe the ghosts of the past still haunt the Ortega Highway; but are these ghost's still lingering? Some believe this road is not only haunted but is also constantly being fed with new deaths. The question we ask is why? Here Forensic Darkness examines the Ortega Highway’s bloody deaths, serial killer connections, and let us not forget, what body dumping's we know of. 

June 3rd, 1970, devil worshipper Steven Craig Hurd carjacked and stabbed 31-year-old mother of five, Florence Nancy Brown. Evidence in this case showed that Brown's body was buried in a shallow grave near El Cariso on the Ortega Highway. Hurd later told prison psychiatrists that he had gone back to the grave site some days after the killing where he dug up the body and ripped out Florence’s heart and ate it as part of a satanic ritual. Hurd died on May 28, 2005, of a brain hemorrhage in prison. He was declared mentally unfit for trial but was later tried in May of 1975 and was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder. For a full overview of this case visit the [Orange County Register](https://www.ocregister.com/articles/hurd-273214-county-orange.html).

In, 1970, serial killer Randy Kraft who killed 16 young men had reported to dump one of his first victims, Wayne Joseph Dukette, off the side of the Ortega Highway. Tragically Wayne’s body was found at the bottom of a ravine.

In, 1980, at milepost 16.50 the Freeway Killer, William Bonin not only molested but dumped 14-year-old Glen Norman Baker of Huntington Beach. Authorities also believe the Freeway Killer dumped at least four of his 21 victims along the Ortega Highway ranging between, 1979, and, 1980.

In, 1977, the "Trash Bag Killer" Patrick Kearney, stuffed one of his first victims into a large trash bag and dumped it on the Ortega Highway.

November 20, 1999, at the Ortega Highway’s Call box 74-88, husband and wife, Dr. Kenneth Stahl & Dr. Carolyn Oppy-Stahl were found shot to death in their car. Police found the couple in their car with the engine running with no signs of any struggle. Police later found this case to be the result of a murder for hire gone bad. Apparently, Dr. Ken Stahl along with his mistress Adriana Vasco hired Dennis Godley to kill his wife.  Unfortunately, the hired killer, Dennis decided to kill Dr. Stahl along with his wife Carolyn after making off with over $20,000 dollars.

In, 2002, Alejandro Avila dumped the body of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion off the Ortega Highway after he had raped and suffocated her. Police found that Avila from Lake Elsinore, California had savagely kidnapped poor little Samantha right outside her home in Stanton, California. For more information visit the Forensic Darkness post about the [Samantha Runnion case](/blog/the-day-children-could-no-longer-play-outside).

In, 2003, police found the body of Jane Bautista at milepost 14. Apparently two men killed then [dumped](https://murderpedia.org/male.B/b/bautista-jason.htm) the body of their decapitated and handless mother on the Ortega Highway.

April 27, 2015, 28-year-old Erica Alonso's decomposed body was found a mile east of the San Juan Capistrano Fire-Ranger station near Hot Springs Road. Although Erica’s body had been dumped, authorities found Erica’s blood alcohol level too high along with GHB also known as the date rape drug in her system. According to police, friends admitted Erica used GHB for recreation; but is this just a way for police to deflect away from the truth that foul play was at work? Since Erica had both alcohol and drugs in her system there is no way she would have had the strength to make it all the way out to the Ortega Highway alone.

One thing to consider is, if Erica’s death was an accident why would her body need to be moved? If she was walking, then the cause of death would have shown in the autopsy that she fell. Erica’s family and supporters know that someone dumped her body to cover something up. If you have information about the death of Erica Alonso, call the Orange County Sheriff's Homicide Unit at 714.647.7055 or 714.647.7000. Anonymous tips can also be left with Orange County Crime Stoppers at 855.847.6227 or by visiting [occrimestoppers.org](https://occrimestoppers.org/) You can also text 274637 from a cell phone. All text messages should begin with the letters "OCCS".
