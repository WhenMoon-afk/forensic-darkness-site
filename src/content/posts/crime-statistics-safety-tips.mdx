*Welcome to Fisher's Facts—where we cut through the noise and give you the information that matters.*

Knowledge is the first line of defense. While true crime media often sensationalizes the exceptional, understanding actual crime statistics helps us assess real risks and take meaningful precautions. Today, we examine the numbers that matter—and the practical steps that actually make a difference.

## The Reality Behind the Headlines

### Violent Crime: Context Matters

According to FBI Uniform Crime Reports and Bureau of Justice Statistics:

- **Violent crime rates have declined approximately 50%** since the early 1990s peak
- **Most violent crimes are committed by someone known to the victim**—not strangers
- **Approximately 70% of homicides** involve victims and offenders who knew each other
- **Domestic violence accounts for roughly 15%** of all violent crime

The stranger-danger narrative dominates media coverage, but statistically, the greatest risks come from people already in our lives.

### Who Is Most at Risk?

Certain demographics face elevated risks:

- **Young adults (18-24)** experience the highest rates of violent victimization
- **Women are significantly more likely** to be victimized by intimate partners
- **Men are more likely** to be victims of stranger violence and homicide overall
- **Low-income individuals** face violent crime rates more than double those of higher-income populations

Understanding these patterns isn't about fear—it's about targeted awareness.

## Serial Murder: Perspective on Rare Events

Serial killers dominate true crime fascination, but perspective matters:

- **Serial murder accounts for less than 1%** of all homicides annually
- The FBI estimates **25-50 active serial killers** in the United States at any given time
- **Your statistical odds of encountering a serial killer** are extraordinarily low
- You are **far more likely to be harmed** by a drunk driver, workplace accident, or domestic partner

This doesn't mean ignoring warning signs—it means directing vigilance appropriately.

## Practical Safety: What Actually Works

### Situational Awareness

The single most effective safety tool requires no equipment:

1. **Stay off your phone** when walking in public, especially at night
2. **Make eye contact** with people around you—predators prefer distracted targets
3. **Trust your instincts**—that uncomfortable feeling exists for evolutionary reasons
4. **Know your exits** in any building or space you enter
5. **Vary your routines**—predictability makes targeting easier

### Home Security

Most burglaries are crimes of opportunity:

- **Lock doors and windows**—approximately 30% of burglars enter through unlocked openings
- **Use timers on lights** when away to simulate occupancy
- **Don't advertise absences** on social media
- **Know your neighbors**—mutual awareness deters crime
- **Secure sliding doors** with a rod in the track

### Digital Safety

Online predators exploit the same vulnerabilities as physical ones:

- **Limit personal information** shared publicly on social media
- **Be cautious with location services**—real-time location sharing enables stalking
- **Verify identities** before meeting anyone from online platforms
- **Trust verification over explanation**—scammers have answers for everything
- **Document harassment immediately**—screenshots with timestamps matter legally

### Relationship Red Flags

Since most violence comes from known individuals, recognizing warning signs is critical:

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Excessive jealousy or possessiveness disguised as love
- Isolating you from friends and family
- Monitoring your communications or location
- Explosive anger over minor issues
- Blaming you for their emotional reactions

**Escalation Indicators:**
- Any physical intimidation (blocking exits, invading space, breaking objects)
- Threats against you, your loved ones, or themselves
- Controlling finances or transportation
- Sexual coercion or boundary violations

If you recognize these patterns, the [National Domestic Violence Hotline](tel:1-800-799-7233) provides confidential support: **1-800-799-7233**.

## What to Do If You're Targeted

### Stalking Response

Stalking affects approximately **7.5 million Americans annually**:

1. **Document everything**—dates, times, witnesses, screenshots
2. **Do not engage**—any response, even negative, rewards the behavior
3. **Tell people**—isolation enables stalkers
4. **Report to police**—even if they can't act immediately, documentation builds cases
5. **Consult a victim advocate**—they know local resources and legal options

### If You Witness a Crime

Bystanders save lives:

- **Call 911 immediately**—don't assume someone else has
- **Be a good witness**—note descriptions, vehicles, direction of travel
- **Don't intervene physically** unless absolutely necessary for safety
- **Stay on the line** with dispatch—they'll guide you

### After Victimization

If the worst happens:

1. **Prioritize physical safety** first
2. **Seek medical attention** even for non-visible injuries
3. **Report to police** as soon as safely possible—you can decide about prosecution later
4. **Contact victim services**—hospitals and police can connect you with advocates
5. **Allow yourself to react**—there's no "correct" emotional response to trauma

## The Balance of Awareness

Understanding crime statistics serves two purposes: it dispels irrational fears while highlighting genuine risks. You shouldn't fear walking to your car—but you should stay aware while doing so. You shouldn't suspect every stranger—but you should trust your instincts about the ones who feel wrong.

The goal isn't paranoia. It's informed confidence.

Most people will never be victims of serious violent crime. But those who stay aware, trust their instincts, and know the warning signs are better positioned to avoid becoming statistics—and to help others who might be at risk.
