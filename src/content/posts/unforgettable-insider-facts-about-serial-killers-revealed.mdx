Serial killers are a subject of great interest for many reasons. As we have seen on TV and in real life, throughout the years serial killers have caused not just fear in the public but fascination. Sadly, in the past law enforcement agencies have learned the hard way that without inter-agency communication, some serial killers who travel may go undetected to the detriment of society.

Another area of concern is the many myths regarding serial killers which some people believe to be true thanks to popular TV shows. Forget the myths because forensic issues delve into the truth and what lies beneath reality, so in order for us as a society to better protect ourselves, we need to further examine serial killers. As horrifying as serial killers are there are truths we need to know for our safety and the safety of those we love.

To combat the overwhelming threat serial killers pose to society, in 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) hosted a [Multi-Disciplinary Symposium](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder) that brought together not just experts on serial murder, but various professionals from different fields, all to identify the unforgettable traits serial killers share (Serial Murders, 2023). Ultimately, the Serial Murder Symposium’s goal was to define and understand true facts about serial killers in such a way that would allow law enforcement to have clear definitions which would help investigators going forward. 

**What is serial murder?**

The symposium experts found that in order for murder to be considered serial, the serial killer must experience a cooling-off period or time between killings (Serial murders, 2023). This cooling-off period could be for any amount of time. Another factor to consider with serial murder is the need to define what serial itself means. The experts then proclaimed the definition of serial murder as the illegal murder of two or more people by the same person or persons during separate incidences (Serial Murders, 2023).

Experts also found that serial killer behavior includes:

- Manipulation.

- Intimidation.

- Charm.

- Not all psychopaths become serial killers. 

- Violence is used to control others.

- Behave in ways that satisfy their own self-needs.

- More prone to stalk victims if sexually motivated.

- Lack of remorse, sensation seeking, the need to control, predatory behavior, and impulsivity.

Serial killers are scary but as a society, we need to be aware and alert to the many dangers we may face, not just with serial killers but with child predators, human traffickers, kidnappers, and more. The goal of Forensic Darkness is to raise awareness and promote safety always so be sure to spread the word.
