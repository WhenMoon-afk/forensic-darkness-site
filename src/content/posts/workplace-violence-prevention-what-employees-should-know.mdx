Workplace violence affects thousands of Americans every year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 20,000 workers experience nonfatal workplace violence annually, and hundreds are killed. These incidents range from verbal threats to physical assaults to mass casualty events.

Understanding workplace violence and knowing how to respond can save lives. This guide provides practical information for employees at every level.

## Types of Workplace Violence

Workplace violence comes from different sources, each requiring different prevention strategies.

**Criminal Intent**

The perpetrator has no legitimate relationship to the workplace. They enter to commit robbery, theft, or another crime. Retail workers, taxi drivers, and those who work late night shifts face elevated risk. Prevention focuses on physical security measures.

**Customer or Client Violence**

The perpetrator is a customer, client, patient, or someone receiving services from the workplace. Healthcare workers, social workers, and customer service employees experience this type most frequently. De-escalation training and policies about acceptable behavior help reduce incidents.

**Worker-on-Worker Violence**

A current or former employee attacks coworkers. These incidents often follow disciplinary action, termination, or interpersonal conflict. Warning signs frequently precede the violence. Threat assessment programs and clear reporting channels are essential prevention tools.

**Personal Relationship Violence**

Someone with a personal relationship to an employee brings violence into the workplace. This often involves domestic violence that spills over into work settings. Employers can help by taking protective orders seriously and adjusting schedules or locations when an employee faces threats.

## Warning Signs

Workplace violence rarely happens without warning. Learning to recognize concerning behaviors can enable early intervention.

**Verbal Warnings**

Direct or indirect threats should always be taken seriously. Statements like "they will be sorry" or "someone should teach them a lesson" signal dangerous thinking. References to weapons, past violent incidents, or revenge fantasies warrant immediate reporting.

**Behavioral Changes**

Watch for employees who show dramatic behavioral shifts: withdrawal from coworkers, declining performance, increased absenteeism, poor hygiene, or emotional volatility. These changes do not necessarily indicate violence risk, but they may signal distress that could escalate.

**Intimidating Behavior**

Behavior intended to frighten others is a red flag. This includes invading personal space, staring, following, blocking exits, or making aggressive gestures. Such behavior should be reported and addressed even if no explicit threat is made.

**Obsessive Focus**

An unhealthy fixation on a coworker, supervisor, or the company itself may precede violence. This includes persistent unwanted attention, excessive complaints about perceived unfairness, or blaming others for all problems.

**Interest in Violence**

Expressions of fascination with weapons, mass shootings, or violent revenge should concern you. So should changes in behavior after termination, discipline, or interpersonal conflict.

## What to Do If You See Warning Signs

If a coworker exhibits concerning behavior, report it. Most organizations have multiple reporting options:

**Human Resources**: Appropriate for concerns about employee behavior, threats, or policy violations.

**Security Department**: Appropriate when you feel physically unsafe or observe immediate threats.

**Management**: Your supervisor can initiate response protocols and provide support.

**Anonymous Tip Lines**: Many organizations offer anonymous reporting for those who fear retaliation.

When reporting, be specific. Describe what you observed, when it happened, who was involved, and any witnesses. Documentation strengthens the organization's ability to respond effectively.

You are not responsible for determining whether someone will become violent. Threat assessment professionals can evaluate the situation. Your job is to report what you observe.

## During an Active Threat

If violence occurs, your priority is survival. The standard guidance is Run, Hide, Fight.

**Run**

If you can safely escape, do so immediately. Leave your belongings. Help others escape if possible, but do not let their hesitation slow you. Once outside, keep moving away from the building. Call 911 when you reach safety.

**Hide**

If escape is not possible, find a secure hiding place. Lock and barricade doors. Turn off lights. Silence your phone. Hide behind large objects away from doors and windows. Stay quiet and still. Do not open the door for anyone until police give the all-clear.

**Fight**

As a last resort, if you cannot run or hide and the attacker is upon you, fight with everything you have. Use improvised weapons: chairs, fire extinguishers, scissors, anything available. Commit fully to the fight. Your goal is to incapacitate the attacker or create an opportunity to escape.

## After an Incident

Workplace violence affects everyone in the organization, not just direct victims. After an incident:

**Follow Instructions**

Law enforcement will secure the scene and may hold witnesses for interviews. Cooperate fully. Do not leave until cleared.

**Seek Medical Attention**

Injuries may not be immediately apparent. Get checked even if you feel fine. Adrenaline can mask pain.

**Access Support Services**

Most employers provide employee assistance programs (EAPs) with free counseling. Use these services. Witnessing violence is traumatic. Professional support aids recovery.

**Document Your Experience**

Write down what you observed while memory is fresh. This documentation may be needed for investigations, workers' compensation claims, or legal proceedings.

## Prevention at the Organizational Level

While individual awareness matters, organizations bear primary responsibility for prevention.

**Threat Assessment Teams**

Trained teams can evaluate concerning behavior and coordinate responses before violence occurs. These teams typically include HR, security, legal, and mental health professionals.

**Clear Policies**

Employees need to know what behavior is prohibited and how to report concerns. Policies should address weapons, threats, harassment, and violence. Consequences for violations must be consistently enforced.

**Physical Security**

Access control, security cameras, panic buttons, and proper lighting reduce opportunities for violence. Layout should allow escape routes and hiding places.

**Training**

All employees should receive training on recognizing warning signs, reporting procedures, and emergency response. Training should be refreshed regularly.

**Support for At-Risk Employees**

Employees dealing with domestic violence, mental health crises, or other challenges need support, not punishment. Organizations that help struggling employees reduce risk for everyone.

## Your Role in Prevention

Workplace safety is a shared responsibility. You contribute by:

Reporting concerning behavior promptly and specifically. Taking threats seriously, even when made in apparent jest. Treating coworkers with respect and addressing conflicts constructively. Knowing your emergency procedures and escape routes. Being aware of your surroundings.

Most workplaces will never experience serious violence. But preparedness saves lives when it does occur. By staying alert and knowing how to respond, you help protect yourself and your colleagues.
