### The Science Behind Solving Crimes

By Victor J. Fisher

January 2, 2025

Every crime leaves evidence. The transfer principle, formulated by forensic scientist Edmond Locard over a century ago, states that every contact leaves a trace. When a person enters a scene, they bring something with them and take something away. The job of forensic science is to find, preserve, analyze, and interpret that evidence.

This guide explains the major types of forensic evidence and how each contributes to criminal investigations.

## Physical Evidence

Physical evidence includes any object that can be collected from a crime scene. This category is broad and forms the foundation of most forensic investigations.

**Weapons**

Firearms, knives, blunt instruments, and other weapons provide crucial evidence. Firearms analysis can match bullets to specific guns through microscopic markings left by the barrel. Blood, tissue, fingerprints, and DNA on weapons can connect them to victims and suspects.

**Clothing and Fabric**

Clothing from victims or suspects can contain blood, hair, fibers, gunshot residue, and other trace evidence. Torn fabric at a scene may match damage to a suspect's clothing. Shoe prints can be compared to specific footwear.

**Glass and Tool Marks**

Broken glass can be matched through fracture patterns and chemical composition. Tool marks on doors, windows, or safes can be compared to specific tools recovered from suspects.

**Documents**

Forged documents, ransom notes, and written communications are analyzed for handwriting characteristics, paper composition, ink formulation, and printing methods. Document examination can link writing samples to specific individuals or sources.

## Biological Evidence

Biological evidence comes from living organisms and includes some of the most powerful evidence available to investigators.

**DNA**

Deoxyribonucleic acid carries genetic information unique to each individual. DNA can be recovered from blood, saliva, skin cells, hair roots, and other biological materials. Modern analysis can generate profiles from extraordinarily small samples.

DNA evidence has transformed criminal justice. It has identified unknown suspects through database searches, confirmed suspect identification, and exonerated hundreds of wrongfully convicted people. Genetic genealogy, which uses DNA to identify suspects through their family members, has solved cold cases decades old.

**Blood**

Blood evidence provides information beyond DNA. Bloodstain pattern analysis interprets the location, direction, and mechanism of bloodshed. Patterns can distinguish between blows, gunshots, and other injury mechanisms. They can reveal the positions of victims and attackers during violent encounters.

**Other Biological Fluids**

Semen in sexual assault cases provides DNA evidence of perpetrators. Saliva on bite marks, cigarette butts, and envelope seals can yield DNA. Urine and sweat, while containing less DNA, can still provide useful biological evidence.

**Hair and Fibers**

Hair analysis can determine whether hair is human or animal, its body location, racial characteristics, and whether it was forcibly removed. Hair roots provide DNA. Hair shafts can be tested for drugs. Fibers from clothing, carpets, and upholstery can connect suspects to scenes through microscopic comparison.

## Fingerprint Evidence

Fingerprints remain one of the most valuable forms of forensic evidence. The friction ridge patterns on fingertips are unique to each individual and remain constant throughout life.

**Types of Fingerprints**

Patent prints are visible to the naked eye, usually left in blood, ink, or other substances. Latent prints are invisible and require development through powders, chemicals, or alternate light sources. Plastic prints are three-dimensional impressions left in soft materials like wax or paint.

**Analysis and Comparison**

Fingerprint examiners compare ridge characteristics between unknown prints from crime scenes and known prints from suspects or databases. The Automated Fingerprint Identification System maintains millions of prints and enables rapid searching.

**Limitations**

Not all surfaces retain fingerprints. Some criminals wear gloves. Partial prints may lack sufficient detail for definitive identification. Despite decades of use, fingerprint comparison involves some subjectivity, and errors do occur.

## Trace Evidence

Trace evidence includes small materials that transfer between people, objects, and environments. These tiny particles often go unnoticed but can provide powerful investigative leads.

**Gunshot Residue**

When a firearm is discharged, particles containing lead, antimony, and barium are deposited on nearby surfaces, including the shooter's hands. Gunshot residue can indicate who fired a weapon and from what distance.

**Paint and Glass**

Automotive paint chips can identify the make, model, and year of vehicles involved in hit-and-run incidents. Glass fragments can be matched to broken windows through refractive index and chemical composition.

**Soil and Plant Material**

Soil adhering to shoes, clothing, or vehicles can be analyzed for mineral content, pollen, and microbial composition. These characteristics can connect individuals to specific geographic locations.

**Fibers and Hairs**

Individual textile fibers and human or animal hairs can transfer between people during physical contact. While single fibers may not be conclusive, patterns of fiber evidence can strongly connect suspects to victims or scenes.

## Digital Evidence

In modern investigations, digital evidence often proves as important as physical evidence.

**Computer Forensics**

Computers contain vast amounts of information: files, communications, internet history, deleted data that can be recovered. Computer forensic analysts extract and interpret this information while maintaining evidence integrity.

**Mobile Device Evidence**

Cell phones record location data, call logs, text messages, photographs, and application usage. This information can establish timelines, locations, and communications relevant to investigations.

**Social Media and Online Activity**

Posts, messages, and interactions on social media platforms can provide evidence of motive, planning, or admissions. Digital footprints are difficult to completely erase.

**Video Surveillance**

Security cameras, dashcams, and doorbell cameras capture visual records of crimes and the people involved. Video enhancement techniques can improve image quality and extract useful details.

## Testimonial Evidence

While not physical evidence, witness statements and suspect interviews contribute essential information to investigations.

**Eyewitness Accounts**

Witnesses may observe crimes, suspects, vehicles, or other relevant details. However, eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. Memory is reconstructive and susceptible to suggestion, stress, and time decay. Investigators must carefully evaluate eyewitness accounts.

**Confessions and Admissions**

Suspect statements, when properly obtained, can directly establish guilt. However, false confessions do occur, particularly among juveniles, people with intellectual disabilities, and those subjected to prolonged interrogation. Corroboration with physical evidence is essential.

**Expert Testimony**

Forensic scientists, medical examiners, and other experts testify about their analysis and conclusions. Their testimony helps judges and juries understand technical evidence.

## Evidence Collection and Preservation

The value of evidence depends on proper collection and preservation. Chain of custody documents everyone who handled evidence from scene to courtroom. Contamination or improper handling can compromise evidence and lead to exclusion at trial.

**Scene Security**

The first priority at any crime scene is securing the area to prevent contamination. Officers establish perimeters, limit access, and document everyone who enters.

**Documentation**

Before anything is moved, scenes are photographed, sketched, and described in notes. This documentation preserves the original condition and relationships between items of evidence.

**Collection Techniques**

Different evidence types require specific collection methods. Biological samples must be dried to prevent degradation. Fingerprints require appropriate lifting techniques. Digital devices need specialized handling to preserve volatile data.

**Packaging and Storage**

Evidence must be packaged to prevent cross-contamination and stored under appropriate conditions. Biological evidence may require refrigeration. Some chemicals are light-sensitive. Improper storage can destroy evidence.

## The Role of Forensic Science in Justice

Forensic evidence serves justice in multiple ways. It identifies perpetrators, enabling arrests and convictions. It excludes innocent people from suspicion, preventing wrongful prosecution. It provides objective information for judges and juries to evaluate.

But forensic science has limitations. Not every crime produces usable evidence. Some evidence types are more reliable than others. Human error affects analysis and interpretation. The justice system must understand both the power and the limits of forensic evidence.

Over 375 people in the United States have been exonerated through DNA evidence after wrongful conviction. Many of these cases involved flawed forensic evidence or testimony. The forensic science community continues to improve methods, validate techniques, and address past errors.

## Conclusion

Forensic evidence comes in many forms, from DNA to digital data, from fingerprints to fibers. Each type has strengths and limitations. Skilled investigators and analysts combine multiple evidence types to build complete pictures of crimes.

Understanding forensic evidence helps citizens serve as informed jurors, recognize the complexity of criminal investigations, and appreciate both the power and the limits of science in achieving justice.

Until next time, stay curious, stay vigilant.
