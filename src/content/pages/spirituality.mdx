At the forefront of forensic issues is mental health, and for those who suffer from depression the thought of suicide may come to mind. Our goal here at Forensic Darkness is to provide hope and healing to those who need help. Spirituality is the core of every human being because we are simply souls inside our bodies. Our energy within us, lives on because we will live on.

Believe it or not, the field of psychology does recognize the mystic as the study of parapsychology. The things that cannot be explained are indeed unseen, but are ultimately the real part of life’s curiosities.

According to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parapsychology), parapsychology is the study of psychic phenomena. This study includes:

- Hauntings and apparitions

- Clairvoyance - reading into far-off locations.

- Telepathy – mind-to-mind communication.

- [ESP](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/esp) - Extrasensory perception - the communication or perceptions outside normal sensory pathways.

- Precognition - visions of the future.

- Psychokinesis & telekinesis - using the mind to move objects.

- Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) - seeing your body from above.

Many of us ask questions about the evil deeds of serial killers because the subject is very interesting. While most of us live struggling to get through each day, we seek answers so we can gain hope and promise that life can get better. Forensic Darkness examines living forensic issues along with the real possible forensic matters of the afterlife. If you are devastated and sad in life, what makes you think you will be any different in death?

Life is precious, and you don’t know how long you have, so make the most of every day. Be the best friend you deserve and never give up. The spirituality section on Forensic Darkness will delve into various spiritual healing techniques, as well as examine the supernatural so we can discover more about what happens after we die. Let’s make today the best life we can, so smile, even if only for yourself!
