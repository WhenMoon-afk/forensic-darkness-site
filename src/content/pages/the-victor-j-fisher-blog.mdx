Welcome to the Victor J. Fisher Forensic Darkness blog, where we delve into the investigations of the infamous Victor J. Fisher, a private investigator with a penchant for hunting down serial killers and ghosts alike.

Victor J. Fisher was born on June 12th, 1979 in Los Angeles, California. He grew up in a troubled home, with his parents constantly fighting and eventually divorcing when he was 12 years old. Victor had always been a solitary child, preferring to keep to himself and read books rather than interact with others.

As he grew older, Victor became more and more interested in law enforcement and criminal justice. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles and earned a degree in Criminal Justice. After graduation, he joined the Los Angeles Police Department and quickly rose through the ranks.

During his time on the force, Victor saw some of the worst things one can imagine, and it took a toll on him. His guilt over a case where he was unable to save an innocent child from a bad guy eventually led him to leave the force and go independent as a freelance private investigator.

Victor's experience in law enforcement and his extensive contacts in the field made him a sought-after investigator, and he quickly built a reputation for his tenacity and ability to get results. He founded the Forensic Darkness Organization with a like-minded partner and began sharing his knowledge with the world through an internet blog.

Victor's dedication to justice and his strong sense of right and wrong have earned him both admirers and detractors. He can come across as cold and detached and his brand of direct unfiltered brutal honesty can rub people the wrong way at times, but he will not give up his fight against the darkness. 

Through his blog and his work with the Forensic Darkness Organization, Victor hopes to make a difference in the world and prevent others from suffering the same fate as the innocent child he was unable to save.
