Forensic Darkness is in full support of those suffering from depression, because life is after all too precious to waste. Forensic Darkness promotes self-love because you are more special than you know.

If you are struggling and need someone to talk to, call or text 988 on your phone anywhere in the U.S. The [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988) is part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMSHA) which was established in 1992 to make treatment for mental disorders and substance disorders more available to people.
