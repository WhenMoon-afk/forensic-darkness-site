After the brutal rape and killing of seven-year-old Megan Kanka in 1994, the U.S. courts ruled that all communities going forward shall be warned about the sex offenders present within our communities.

The [Megan's Law site](https://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/Search.aspx) allows you to not only obtain the name and picture of all sex offenders in your area but you also can view the sex offender's crime as well as any alias' they may have used in the past.

Forensic Darkness is dedicated to protecting our children by providing as much information as possible to help see our children stay safe.
