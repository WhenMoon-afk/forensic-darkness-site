The Doe Network is the International Center for Unidentified and Missing Persons and was established in 1999 to help bring about justice for those yet to be identified.

Anyone involved in a missing person’s case should visit the [DoeNetwork](https://www.doenetwork.org/uid-geo-us-males.php) which allows you to search by state, gender, or country. In your search, if you locate someone who could be your missing loved one, the DoeNetwork encourages you to submit your DNA to the [National Missing and Unidentified Persons System](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/services/dna) to see if you are a match.

Forensic Darkness aims to provide help, resources, ideas, or anything that will help victims of crime find the peace and justice they so greatly deserve.
