**Crime Victim's Right to Assistance**

Established in 1988 as a response to the Victim of Crime Act which is part of the Victim's Rights Compensation, and Assistance law, a law designed to help victims become whole after a crime. According to the [Victim's rights law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/34/20141), victims are allowed relief, and restitution after a crime. Victims may also receive help with future protection in the event a victim feels unsafe.
