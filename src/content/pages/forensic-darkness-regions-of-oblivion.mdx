History and ghost hunters alike agree that when tragic events happen, land can become tainted not only by blood but by the souls who lost their lives at these locations. Perhaps the land is a magnet to those facing death. You might ask, do serial killers dump their bodies in abandoned terrain in hopes no one will discover their sins, or are they dumping the bodies because the land is calling out to them for blood? 

Do the many people who die sudden deaths on regions of demise die because they are just another number the land calls for? The fact is that some locations become all too familiar with death so perhaps this phenomena can no longer be ignored.  Join Forensic Darkness as we begin our journey to honor those lost in regions of oblivion. Here Forensic Darkness explores the many grounds all too familiar with loss and eternal sleep.
