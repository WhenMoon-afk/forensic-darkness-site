          <p class="text-fd-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Forensic Darkness strives for accuracy in all published content. We research
            thoroughly, cite reputable sources, and verify facts before publication.
            However, we recognize that errors can occur. When they do, we believe in
            transparency and prompt correction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-fd-muted leading-relaxed">
            We owe this to our readers, to the victims and families we write about,
            and to the integrity of the educational mission we pursue.

                Typos, grammatical errors, broken links, and minor factual errors that
                do not substantially change the meaning or conclusions of an article.
                These are corrected silently in most cases.

                Fundamental errors that undermine the premise or conclusions of an article,
                or content that should not have been published. These warrant prominent
                correction notices at the top of articles or, in extreme cases, retraction
                of the entire piece with explanation.
