          Forensic Darkness is dedicated to informing victims with help and resources while exploring the psychology of serial killers and violent crime.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Serial killers don't just hatch overnight—they are the product of years of circumstances and thought processes which makes killing the one thing that drives them forward. This site provides information about the many mental illnesses and personality disorders common among these offenders, as well as provide help for victims and families to help keep them safe from kidnappers, child molesters, and serial killers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We as a community need to know our enemy in order to educate our children on how to stay safe. This subject may not be the easiest to digest but it has been one of much interest.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Forensic Darkness?</h2>
        <p>
          Forensic darkness is the trauma caused to the victim. It represents the shadow that violent crime casts over survivors and their families. Through education and awareness, we aim to bring light to these dark corners of human experience.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-display font-bold mb-4">Don't Be Scared, Be Aware!</h3>
          <p class="text-fd-muted mb-0">
            Safety comes first. Instead of being scared, be aware! A serial killer may not be who you imagine them to be, which means we all need to keep our eyes open. As humans we are instinctive. Trust your instincts and stay aware of the danger.
