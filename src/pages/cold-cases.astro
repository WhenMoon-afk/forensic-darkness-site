    status: "Arrest Made - Trial Pending",
    victims: ["Abigail Williams, 13", "Liberty German, 14"],
    summary: "Two teenage girls were murdered while hiking on the Delphi Historic Trails. Liberty German captured audio and video of the suspect on her phone before the attack. The footage shows a man in jeans and a blue jacket walking on the bridge, with audio of him saying 'down the hill.' Despite widespread publicity of this evidence, the case remained unsolved for years. In October 2022, Richard Allen was arrested and charged with the murders. His trial is pending.",

    status: "Unsolved",
    victims: ["11 women and 1 fetus identified", "Possibly more unidentified"],
    summary: "In February 2009, a woman walking her dog discovered human bones on Albuquerque's West Mesa. Subsequent excavation revealed the remains of at least 11 women and one fetus. Most victims were young women involved in prostitution and drug use who had disappeared between 2003 and 2005. The killer buried victims in a systematic pattern, leading investigators to believe this was a single serial offender. Despite extensive investigation, no arrests have been made.",
    evidence: ["Burial patterns suggest organized offender", "Victims shared similar backgrounds", "Geographic cluster of disappearances"],

    summary: "Between 1986 and 1989, four couples were attacked along Virginia's Colonial Parkway and surrounding areas. The victims were young couples in parked cars at isolated locations. Some were found in or near their vehicles; others disappeared entirely. The FBI believes the same person or persons committed all four attacks. No suspect has ever been identified, though theories range from a law enforcement impersonator to a serial killer with knowledge of the area.",

All victims were dark-haired women working alone in small shops. Each was shot with a .22 caliber handgun. The killer struck quickly and left few witnesses. A composite sketch was developed from witness descriptions, but no suspect has been identified.",
    evidence: ["Consistent victim type (dark-haired women)", "Same caliber weapon used", "All victims worked alone in retail", "Composite sketch available"],

These include 'Jane Doe No. 6,' an Asian male victim and toddler found together, and a woman found in a burlap sack. Some may be victims of other perpetrators. Investigators continue working to identify all remains and determine how many killers used this location.",
